          Rooted by fuzzy guitar tones, Wedgy weaves in synths and digital
          production techniques to define their sound. With clear nods to both
          post-punk and shoe-gaze, harsh tones meet ethereal synth and backing
          vocals lines. The tone accompanies the deep insight into internal
          challenges that are represented on face value through the narrative.

          The band developed inspiration in the juxtaposition of travel and
          homecoming. After a stint crafting electronic landscapes during their
          time in Brazil, a return home to the familiar surroundings, guitars in
          hand, shifted the sound back into the alt rock scene.

          Live performances, whether as a 3-piece or solo, prove to provide a
          dynamic range in both noise and energy with tones ranging from harsh
          fuzz to delicate atmospheric synths.
